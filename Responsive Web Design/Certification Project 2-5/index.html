        <h2>1962–1967: Early career to debut album</h2>
        <p id="tribute-info">
            Bowie formed his first band, the Konrads, in 1962 at the age of 15. Playing guitar-based rock and roll at local
            youth gatherings and weddings, the Konrads had a varying line-up of between four and eight members, Underwood among them.
            When Bowie left the technical school the following year, he informed his parents of his intention to become a pop star.
            His mother arranged his employment as an electrician's mate. Frustrated by his bandmates' limited aspirations,
            Bowie left the Konrads and joined another band, the King Bees. He wrote to the newly successful washing-machine
            entrepreneur John Bloom inviting him to "do for us what Brian Epstein has done for the Beatles—and make another million."
            Bloom did not respond to the offer, but his referral to Dick James's partner Leslie Conn led to Bowie's first personal management contract.

        <h2>1968–1971: Space Oddity to Hunky Dory</h2>
        <p>
            Studying the dramatic arts under Lindsay Kemp, from avant-garde theatre and mime to commedia dell'arte, Bowie became immersed in the creation
            of personae to present to the world. Satirising life in a British prison, the Bowie composition "Over The Wall We Go" became a 1967 single for Oscar;
            another Bowie song, "Silly Boy Blue", was released by Billy Fury the following year.[37] Playing acoustic guitar, Hermione Farthingale
            formed a group with Bowie and guitarist John Hutchinson named Feathers; between September 1968 and early 1969 the trio gave a small number
            of concerts combining folk, Merseybeat, poetry, and mime.
            <br><br>
            After the break-up with Farthingale, Bowie moved in with Mary Finnigan
            as her lodger.[39] In February and March 1969, he undertook a short tour
            with Marc Bolan's duo Tyrannosaurus Rex, as third on the bill, performing a mime act. On 11 July 1969, "Space Oddity" was released five days ahead
            of the Apollo 11 launch, and reached the top five in the UK. Continuing the divergence from rock and roll and blues begun by his work with Farthingale,
            Bowie joined forces with Finnigan, Christina Ostrom and Barrie Jackson to run a folk club on Sunday nights at the Three Tuns pub in Beckenham High Street.
            The club was influenced by the Arts Lab movement, developing into the Beckenham Arts Lab and became extremely popular. The Arts Lab hosted a free festival
            in a local park, the subject of his song "Memory of a Free Festival".

        <h2>1974–1976: "Plastic soul" and the Thin White Duke</h2>
        <p>
            Bowie moved to the US in 1974, initially staying in New York City before settling in Los Angeles.
            Diamond Dogs (1974), parts of which found him heading towards soul and funk, was the product of two distinct ideas:
            a musical based on a wild future in a post-apocalyptic city, and setting George Orwell's 1984 to music.
            The album went to number one in the UK, spawning the hits "Rebel Rebel" and "Diamond Dogs", and number five in the US.
            To promote it, Bowie launched the Diamond Dogs Tour, visiting cities in North America between June and December 1974.
            Choreographed by Toni Basil, and lavishly produced with theatrical special effects, the high-budget stage production was
            filmed by Alan Yentob. The resulting documentary, Cracked Actor, featured a pasty and emaciated Bowie: the tour coincided
            with his slide from heavy cocaine use into addiction, producing severe physical debilitation, paranoia, and emotional problems.
            He later commented that the accompanying live album, David Live, ought to have been titled "David Bowie Is Alive and Well and Living Only in Theory".
            David Live nevertheless solidified Bowie's status as a superstar, charting at number two in the UK and number eight in the US. It also spawned a UK
            number ten hit in Bowie's cover of Eddie Floyd's "Knock on Wood". After a break in Philadelphia, where Bowie recorded new material, the tour resumed
            with a new emphasis on soul.

        <h2>1976–1979: Berlin era</h2>
        <p>
            Before the end of 1976, Bowie's interest in the burgeoning German music scene, as well as his drug addiction, prompted him to move
            to West Berlin to clean up and revitalise his career. There he was often seen riding a bicycle between his apartment on Hauptstraße
            in Schöneberg and Hansa Tonstudio, the recording studio he used, located on Köthener Straße in Kreuzberg, near the Berlin Wall.
            While working with Brian Eno and sharing an apartment with Iggy Pop, he began to focus on minimalist, ambient music for the first of three albums,
            co-produced with Tony Visconti, that became known as the Berlin Trilogy.[100] During the same period, Iggy Pop, with Bowie as a co-writer and musician,
            completed his solo album debut The Idiot and its follow-up Lust for Life, touring the UK, Europe, and the US in March and April 1977.

        <h2>1980–1988: New Romantic and pop era</h2>
        <p>
            Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps) (1980) produced the number-one hit "Ashes to Ashes", featuring the textural work of guitar-synthesist
            Chuck Hammer and revisiting the character of Major Tom from "Space Oddity". The song gave international exposure to the underground
            New Romantic movement when Bowie visited the London club "Blitz"—the main New Romantic hangout—to recruit several of the regulars
            (including Steve Strange of the band Visage) to act in the accompanying video, renowned as one of the most innovative of all time. While Scary
            Monsters used principles established by the Berlin albums, it was considered by critics to be far more direct musically and lyrically.
            The album's hard rock edge included conspicuous guitar contributions from Robert Fripp, Chuck Hammer, and Pete Townshend.
            As "Ashes to Ashes" hit number one on the UK charts, Bowie opened a five-month run on Broadway on 29 July, starring
            as John Merrick in The Elephant Man.
            <br><br>
            Bowie paired with Queen in 1981 for a one-off single release, "Under Pressure". The duet was a hit, becoming Bowie's third UK number-one single.
            Bowie was given the lead role in the BBC's 1982 televised adaptation of Bertolt Brecht's play Baal. Coinciding with its transmission,
            a five-track EP of songs from the play, recorded earlier in Berlin, was released as David Bowie in Bertolt Brecht's Baal. In March 1982,
            the month before Paul Schrader's film Cat People came out, Bowie's title song, "Cat People (Putting Out Fire)", was released as a single,
            becoming a minor US hit and entering the UK Top 30.

        <h2>1989–1991: Tin Machine</h2>
        <p>
            Bowie shelved his solo career in 1989, retreating to the relative anonymity of band membership for the first time since the early 1970s.
            A hard-rocking quartet, Tin Machine came into being after Bowie began to work experimentally with guitarist Reeves Gabrels.
            The line-up was completed by Tony and Hunt Sales, whom Bowie had known since the late 1970s for their contribution, on bass
            and drums respectively, to Iggy Pop's 1977 album Lust for Life.[142] The Sales brothers are sons of American comedian and actor Soupy Sales.

            Although he intended Tin Machine to operate as a democracy, Bowie dominated, both in songwriting and in decision-making.
            The band's album debut, Tin Machine (1989), was initially popular, though its politicised lyrics did not find universal approval:
            Bowie described one song as "a simplistic, naive, radical, laying-it-down about the emergence of Neo-Nazis"; in the view of Sandford,
            "It took nerve to denounce drugs, fascism and TV ... in terms that reached the literary level of a comic book."[144] EMI complained of "lyrics that preach"
            as well as "repetitive tunes" and "minimalist or no production".[145] The album nevertheless reached number three and went gold in the UK.

        <h2>1992–1998: Electronic period</h2>
        <p>
            On 20 April 1992, Bowie appeared at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, following the Queen singer's death the previous year.
            As well as performing "'Heroes'" and "All the Young Dudes", he was joined on "Under Pressure" by Annie Lennox, who took Mercury's
            vocal part; during his appearance, Bowie knelt and recited the Lord's Prayer at Wembley Stadium.[154][155] Four days later, Bowie
            and Iman were married in Switzerland. Intending to move to Los Angeles, they flew in to search for a suitable property, but found
            themselves confined to their hotel, under curfew: the 1992 Los Angeles riots began the day they arrived. They settled in New York instead.

        <h2>1999–2012: Neoclassicist era</h2>
        <p>
            Bowie, with Gabrels, created the soundtrack for Omikron: The Nomad Soul, a 1999 computer game in which he and Iman also voiced
            characters based on their likenesses. Released the same year and containing re-recorded tracks from Omikron, his album Hours featured
            a song with lyrics by the winner of his "Cyber Song Contest" Internet competition, Alex Grant. Making extensive use of live instruments,
            the album was Bowie's exit from heavy electronica.[170] Hours and a performance on VH1 Storytellers in mid-1999 represented the end of
            Gabrels' association with Bowie as a performer and songwriter.[171] Sessions for the planned album Toy, intended to feature new versions
            of some of Bowie's earliest pieces as well as three new songs, commenced in 2000, but the album remained officially unreleased until 2021.
            Bowie and Visconti continued their collaboration, producing a new album of completely original songs instead: the result of the sessions was the 2002 album Heathen.
            <br><br>
            On 25 June 2000, Bowie made his second appearance at the Glastonbury Festival in England, playing 30 years after his first. The performance was released
            as a posthumous live album in November 2018.[175] On 27 June, Bowie performed a concert at the BBC Radio Theatre in London, which was released
            on the compilation album Bowie at the Beeb; this also featured BBC recording sessions from 1968 to 1972.[176] Bowie and Iman's daughter was born on 15 August.
            His interest in Buddhism led him to support the Tibetan cause by performing at the February 2001 and February 2003 concerts to support Tibet House US at
            Carnegie Hall in New York.

        <h2>2013–2016: Final years</h2>
        <p>
            On 8 January 2013, his 66th birthday, his website announced a new album, to be titled The Next Day and scheduled for release in March.
            Bowie's first studio album in a decade, The Next Day contains 14 songs plus 3 bonus tracks.[205][206] His website acknowledged the length of his hiatus.
            Producer and longtime collaborator Tony Visconti said 29 tracks were recorded for the album, some of which could appear on Bowie's next record,
            which he might start work on later in 2013. The announcement was accompanied by the immediate release of a single, "Where Are We Now?", written
            and recorded by Bowie in New York and produced by Visconti.
            <br><br>
            A music video for "Where Are We Now?" was released onto Vimeo the same day, directed by New York artist Tony Oursler.
            The single topped the UK iTunes Chart within hours of its release,[208] and debuted in the UK Singles Chart at number six,
            his first single to enter the Top 10 for two decades (since "Jump They Say" in 1993). A second video, "The Stars (Are Out Tonight)",
            was released 25 February. Directed by Floria Sigismondi, it stars Bowie and Tilda Swinton as a married couple. On 1 March, the album was
            made available to stream for free through iTunes.[211] The Next Day debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart, was his first album to
            achieve that position since Black Tie White Noise (1993), and was the fastest-selling album of 2013 at the time. The music video for the song
            "The Next Day" created some controversy, initially being removed from YouTube for terms-of-service violation, then restored with a warning
            recommending viewing only by those 18 or over.
